The goal is to share possibilities of improvement in web development by discovering new trends, ideas, technologies and techniques from different sources and through projects.  

We learn everyday by doing and understanding. 


## What's with the name?

This blog is part of my personality as *inquisitive* means being intensely curious about something (with a positive intention) and the name *Jane* comes from being just 'Plain Jane', a not-so-attractive but simple girl with a passion to explore new things in the world of Computer Programming. 


## Curiousity kills the cat, really?

My passion has driven me to back-end development. Learning from experiences in creating both native Android and iOS apps, I realize most mobile apps rely on APIs and online databases. 

A social media app obviously needs a remote server running from the background to retrieve and store data in real-time. When you order food from Mcdonalds online using their app, there is a web server that communicates with you through your phone. 

Learning how to use NodeJS transformed me into an open-minded type of developer. I can see a lot of possibilities for a big chunk of data to be usable to many kinds of apps. I learned to appreciate the importance of data and how this affects the usability of an app. 


## So, what now? Any Plans?

There is a lot to learn according to this [roadmap](https://codeburst.io/the-2018-web-developer-roadmap-826b1b806e8d?fbclid=IwAR3MpZP0iLCCymSoxudH6aYjzxBFLo6H06Gjy1O0HDupf_0HInq5kG5jykw).

Happy Coding! üòÑüëç
